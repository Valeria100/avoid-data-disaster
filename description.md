# Outline

It has been said that 80% of data analysis is spent on the process of cleaning and preparing the data. Not only does this represent a significant time investment for the data analyst, but is often a hurdle for the non-specialist trying to get to grips with analysing their own data after attending an R or Python course. Despite the best intentions, a spreadsheet that is intuitive and easily-understandable by human eyes can lead to disaster when trying to process computationally.

This workshop will go through the basic principles that we can all adopt in order to work with data more effectively and "think like a computer". Moreover, we will discuss the best practices for data management and organisation so that our research is auditable and reproducible by ourselves, and others, in the future.

# Aims: During this course you will learn about
- How to use spreadsheet programs (such as Excel) more effectively, and the limitations of such programs
- Getting data out of spreadsheets in a form ameanable for analysis with command-line tools
- Best practices for data management and project management
- Resources available at CRUK C.I. for data backup
